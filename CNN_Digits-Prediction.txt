Dataset:

Name: MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset
Source: TensorFlow Datasets
Description:
28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
Labels are integers from 0 to 9.
Includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

Model Architecture:
The model is a CNN designed to extract spatial features from images and classify them into one of 10 digit classes (0-9). The architecture includes:

Input Layer:
Preprocessed images resized to (28, 28, 1).
Convolutional Layers:
Three convolutional layers with ReLU activation and kernel sizes of 3x3.
Followed by Batch Normalization to stabilize training.
Pooling Layers:
Max Pooling to downsample feature maps.
Fully Connected Layers:
Flattened output connected to dense layers with ReLU activation.
Includes Dropout to prevent overfitting.
Output Layer:
Softmax activation for multi-class classification (10 classes).

Implementation Steps

1. Data Preprocessing:

Normalized image pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Reshaped images to include a channel dimension: (28, 28, 1).

2. Data Augmentation:

Applied random transformations like rotations and zooms to enhance training data variability.

3. Model Training:

Optimizer: Adam
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
Metric: Accuracy
Techniques:
Early Stopping to terminate training when validation performance stops improving.
Learning Rate Reduction on performance plateaus.

4. Model Evaluation:

Achieved high accuracy on the test set, ensuring good generalization.

5. Prediction:

A custom function accepts new images, preprocesses them, and predicts the digit with a confidence score.

Requirements:

Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.0+
